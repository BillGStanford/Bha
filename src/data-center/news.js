The reason for the creation of this new state, Bhari, is not rooted in any desire to engage in conflict or to destroy Eritrea, 
but rather to offer an alternative avenue for Eritrea and its people to thrive within the global economic landscape. 
Eritrea, while facing numerous external challenges, has consistently shown resilience and determination in its pursuit of independence and self-sufficiency. 
The goal is to ensure that Eritrea continues to succeed in the future, and we believe that by establishing Bhari, we can forge a path that benefits both Eritrea and the new state, 
creating many opportunities for shared prosperity and success.

This concept is not entirely new. A similar arrangement has already been successfully implemented by Monaco and France, where both entities benefit from their unique geopolitical and economic relationship. The creation of Bhari as an independent entity is inspired by such models and is intended to provide a framework where both countries—Eritrea and Bhari—can work in tandem to elevate their standing within the global economy. Our vision is to bridge the gaps that currently exist in Eritrea's economic zone of interest, facilitating opportunities for investment, trade, and collaboration, 
all while respecting Eritrea’s sovereignty and its people's values.

One of the critical areas we aim to address is ensuring that Eritrea does not have to sacrifice its economic principles, particularly the core values of an economy driven by the workers. However, we also recognize the need for Eritrea to engage with modern capital and technology in order to continue progressing and advancing. Through the establishment of Bhari, we will create a structure that supports both systems: 
one that honors the socialist ideals of Eritrea’s economy while providing access to capital that can help modernize industries, infrastructure, and technology.

By developing Bhari, we can implement mechanisms that allow Eritrea to benefit from external capital, not just as a passive recipient, but as an active partner. Bhari can negotiate deals, provide trade routes, and facilitate financial transactions that will help Eritrea achieve its long-term goals. Our state will focus on leveraging international markets, capital flows, and partnerships that can enable Eritrea to secure the resources needed for modernization, without compromising its commitment to workers’ rights or the integrity of its socialist framework. In essence, 
we will be the catalyst to help Eritrea access the global economy in ways that align with its values, but with an eye toward future growth and sustainability.

The foundation of Bhari is built upon the notion of respect for the worker. In our nation, we prioritize the rights of workers and strive to ensure that they are treated with dignity, fairness, and respect. We believe that a robust economy can only be built upon the principles of equality and fairness, which is why healthcare, education, and social welfare will be protected as fundamental human rights. Our society will focus on strengthening the social fabric by 
ensuring access to quality services that allow every individual to live with dignity and pursue opportunities for personal growth and advancement.

Bhari’s creation is not a reactionary move, but a proactive step toward a mutually beneficial future. By placing workers at the forefront of our policies and practices, and by fostering economic partnerships that benefit both Eritrea and our new nation, we can ensure that both entities thrive in a complex, interconnected world. The new state is an opportunity not just for Bhari, but for Eritrea, to secure its place in the global economic system while maintaining its independence, principles, and values. Through collaboration and respect, we believe that Bhari and Eritrea can succeed together, creating a future of shared prosperity, 
where economic growth, justice, and the well-being of workers are at the heart of our endeavors.
